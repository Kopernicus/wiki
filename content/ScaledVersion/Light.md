The `Light { }` subnode of the `ScaledVersion { }` node describes the light quality of the star itself. 

**Example**
```
Light
{
  sunlightColor = 1.0,0.384,0.345,1.0
  sunlightIntensity = 0.9
  sunlightShadowStrength = 0.75
  scaledSunlightColor = 1.0,0.384,0.345,1.0
  scaledSunlightIntensity = 0.9
  IVASunColor = 1.0,0.384,0.345,1.0
  IVASunIntensity = 0.9
  ambientLightColor = 0.6,0.06,0.06,1.0
  sunLensFlareColor = 1.0,0.352,0.301,1.0
  givesOffLight = true

|Property|Format|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|sunFlare|File Path|The path to an asset bundle containing a Unity LensFlare object that should be applied to the star.|
|sunlightColor|Color|The color of the LocalSpace starlight. Influences vessels and PQS terrain.|
|sunlightIntensity|Single|The intensity of the LocalSpace starlight. Usage not recommended, because of a lacking distance limit. Use IntensityCurve instead.|
|sunlightShadowStrength|Single|The strength of the shadows caused by LocalSpace starlight.|
|scaledSunlightColor|Color|The color of the ScaledSpace starlight. Influences the ScaledSpace representation of the bodies.|
|scaledSunlightIntensity|Single|The intensity of the ScaledSpace starlight. Usage not recommended, because of a lacking distance limit. Use ScaledIntensityCurve instead.|
|IVASunColor|Color|The color of the starlight in IVA view.|
|IVASunIntensity|Single|The intensity of the IVA starlight. Usage not recommended, because of a lacking distance limit. Use IVAIntensityCurve instead.|
|ambientLightColor|Color|The color of ambient lighting when orbiting near the star.|
|sunLensFlareColor|Color|The color of the star's LensFlare effect. Gets multiplied with the color of the base texture (yellow-ish for stock flare).|
|givesOffLight|Boolean|Whether the star should emit light and have a LensFlare effect, or whether it's an object like a black hole.|
|sunAU|Double|Distance in meters. ?Something to do with setting AU from parent star to home world? What's it for? we know it does not affect star luminosity calculation.|
|luminosity|Double|Misnomer. Insolation in watts per square meter at Kerbin's orbit. Calculate for other stars as the (starLuminosity)^0.5 * 1360, where starLuminosity = 1 is the starLuminosity of the stock sun (roughly 1/100th the luminosity of the real world sun). You can use it to calculate the starLuminosity by 4 * Math.PI * kerbinAU * kerbinAU * luminosity. |
|insolation|Double| ?value modifying _luminosity_ for power reaching surface?|
|radiationFactor|Double|?Description here?|
|brightnessCurve|FloatCurve|Associates a distance value with a multiplier for the brightness of the LensFlare effect. The distances are measured in 1/`AU` value, with 0 being the farthest. See the example above for more info.|
|IntensityCurve|FloatCurve|Associates a distance value (in meters) with a value that describes the intensity of the LocalSpace starlight at that point.|
|ScaledIntensityCurve|FloatCurve|Associates a distance value (in meters / 6000) with a value that describes the intensity of the ScaledSpace starlight at that point.|
|IVAIntensityCurve|FloatCurve|Associates a distance value (in meters) with a value that describes the intensity of the IVA starlight at that point.|
