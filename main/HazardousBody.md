title: HazardousBody
---

The `HazardousBody { }` subnode of the `Body { }` node indicates that the body is hazardous, and thus, the body will gradually apply heat to the vessel as the vessel nears the body. It replaces `HazardousOceans { }` as the `HazardousBody { }` has more fine control and detail.
