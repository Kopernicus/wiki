# PQS Main Shader

**Shader:** `Terrain/PQS/PQS Main Shader` &nbsp;·&nbsp; **`materialType = Main`**

The PQS `Material { }` drives the shader that paints a body's **near-surface terrain** — the real, subdivided quad-sphere you see from low orbit down to the ground. This is the counterpart to the [ScaledVersion materials](/Syntax/Material/Scaled/Vacuum), which paint only the distant low-LOD sphere; the PQS material takes over as the camera descends and the two are cross-faded across the [`fadeStart` / `fadeEnd`](/Syntax/PQS) altitudes. `Terrain/PQS/PQS Main Shader` is the canonical, full-featured member of the "PQS Main" family.

Unlike the scaled-space shaders, which sample a single pre-baked colour map, the PQS Main shader builds the surface procedurally from a small set of tiling textures. It is **world-space triplanar** — it projects each texture down the three world axes and blends them by the surface normal, so there are no UV seams and a handful of textures can clothe an entire planet. On top of that it blends three textures by **elevation**, layers a separate texture on **steep slopes**, crossfades between a fine and a coarse tiling by **camera distance**, and (on bodies with an atmosphere) folds in aerial-perspective haze and underwater fog.

`Main` is one of the pre-1.8 terrain shaders. It is the richest of the height-blend variants — every elevation band carries its own normal map with independent near/far tiling. If you want the same look with a lighter texture/normal budget, see the [Optimized](/Syntax/Material/PQS/Optimized) variant; for the 1.8-era blend used by stock Kerbin's terrain, see [MainFastBlend](/Syntax/Material/PQS/MainFastBlend); for the PBR zoom-rotation variant, see [MainTriplanarZoomRotation](/Syntax/Material/PQS/MainTriplanarZoomRotation).

We shall first see how to enable the material, then how the shader assembles the surface, and finally discuss each group of properties in turn.

## Enabling

Select the material by setting `materialType = Main` in the [`PQS { }`](/Syntax/PQS) node. The `Material { }` node then accepts the properties listed below.

```
PQS
{
    materialType = Main
    Material
    {
        // Colour grading of the per-vertex colour map
        saturation = 1
        contrast   = 1
        tintColor  = 1, 1, 1, 0

        // How strongly the textures show, and the near/far crossfade distance
        powerNear      = 0.5
        powerFar       = 0.5
        groundTexStart = 2000
        groundTexEnd   = 10000

        // Low elevation band
        lowTex          = MyMod/PluginData/sand_color.dds
        lowBumpMap      = MyMod/PluginData/sand_normal.dds
        lowNearTiling   = 1000
        lowMultiFactor  = 10

        // Mid elevation band
        midTex          = MyMod/PluginData/rock_color.dds
        midBumpMap      = MyMod/PluginData/rock_normal.dds
        midNearTiling   = 1000
        midMultiFactor  = 10

        // High elevation band
        highTex         = MyMod/PluginData/snow_color.dds
        highBumpMap     = MyMod/PluginData/snow_normal.dds
        highNearTiling  = 1000
        highMultiFactor = 10

        // Where each band fades to the next (on normalised vertex elevation)
        lowStart  = 0
        lowEnd    = 0.3
        highStart = 0.8
        highEnd   = 1

        // Steep-slope overlay
        steepTex      = MyMod/PluginData/cliff_color.dds
        steepBumpMap  = MyMod/PluginData/cliff_normal.dds
        steepPower    = 1

        // Atmospheric haze (only visible on bodies with an atmosphere)
        globalDensity = 1
        fogColorRamp  = MyMod/PluginData/fog_ramp.dds
    }
}
```

## How the surface is built

The shader is a triplanar terrain surface assembled per pixel. There is no single colour map; instead a base colour, three elevation textures, a steep overlay, and fog are combined in the following order:

1. **Per-vertex colour grading** — the PQS supplies a colour per vertex (`COLOR.rgb`, usually from a colour map or [LandControl](/Syntax/PQSMods/LandControl/LandControl)). The shader desaturates that colour toward its luma by `saturation`, mixes in `tintColor` (whose alpha is the mix amount), and scales it by `contrast`. The result is the **base colour** that the band textures then tint.
2. **Three elevation bands** — `lowTex`, `midTex` and `highTex` are blended by the vertex's normalised elevation (written into `COLOR.w` by the PQS height build). `lowStart`/`lowEnd` set the elevation window where the low band fades up into the mid band, and `highStart`/`highEnd` the window where the mid band fades into the high band — so low covers the bottom of the height range, mid the middle, high the top.
3. **Near/far tiling crossfade** — each band is sampled at two tiling scales and crossfaded by camera distance: a fine **near** tiling (`*NearTiling`) for close-up detail and a coarse **far** tiling (`*MultiFactor`) for the distance, blended between the `groundTexStart` and `groundTexEnd` view distances. `powerNear` and `powerFar` set how strongly the near and far textures show. Because the triplanar coordinates are world position scaled by 10⁻⁵, the tiling numbers are large (the defaults are 1000 near, 10 far).
4. **Texture vs. flat colour** — the blended band texture does not replace the base colour, it *modulates* it: the final albedo is `lerp(baseColour, baseColour × bandTexture, texMix)`, where `texMix` is driven by `powerNear`/`powerFar` and the near/far mix. Where it falls to zero — far away, or with both powers at 0 — you see the flat graded colour map; where it is high you see fully textured terrain.
5. **Steep-slope overlay** — `steepTex` and `steepBumpMap` are blended over the result on steep terrain. The per-vertex steepness is multiplied by `steepPower` and clamped, so higher `steepPower` makes the cliff texture reach onto gentler slopes. The overlay has its own distance fade between `steepTexStart` and `steepTexEnd`, and its own `steepNearTiling` / `steepTiling`.
6. **Normal mapping** — each band and the steep overlay carry a matching DXT5nm normal map, accumulated at the same band/near/far weights and transformed into world space through the mesh's tangent frame. The surface is then lit with a plain diffuse (Lambert) term plus spherical-harmonic ambient — there is **no specular highlight**.
7. **Aerial-perspective & ocean fog** — on a body with an atmosphere, a distance haze is mixed in last. Its colour is read from `fogColorRamp` indexed by the sun angle, and its strength grows with distance and `globalDensity`. A second, underwater **ocean fog** term reads the same ramp at a different row. On an airless body the whole fog stage is compiled out and these properties do nothing. (`Main` does not expose `oceanFogDistance`; the variants that do — such as [Extra](/Syntax/Material/PQS/Extra) — let you tune the underwater falloff distance.)

The triplanar projection means the band textures need **no UV mapping** on the mesh, but the normal mapping still needs mesh **tangents**, which the PQS quad-sphere provides. Because the colour, elevation and slope all come from the PQS build, the final look depends as much on your [PQSMods](/Syntax/PQSMods/) (height, colour, LandControl) as on the textures set here.

## Properties

The properties fall into five groups, which we shall take in turn:

1. **Colour grading** — how the per-vertex colour map is processed before texturing.
2. **Texture blend & distance** — the near/far strengths and the crossfade distances.
3. **Elevation bands** — the three height textures, their normal maps, tiling and transition windows.
4. **Steep-slope overlay** — the cliff texture for steep terrain.
5. **Fog & opacity** — the atmospheric haze ramp and the PQS fade scalar.

### Colour grading

## Notes

* These are the body's **near-surface** terrain materials. The body simultaneously has a [ScaledVersion material](/Syntax/Material/Scaled/Vacuum) for the distant sphere; KSP cross-fades between the two across the [`fadeStart` / `fadeEnd`](/Syntax/PQS) altitudes, so the two should be tuned to match where they meet.
* The textures are **world-space triplanar**, so they need no UVs and the tiling values are in world units scaled by 10⁻⁵ (hence the large defaults). The shader still requires mesh **tangents** for its normal mapping, which the PQS quad-sphere provides.
* The band colour, the per-vertex elevation that drives the band blend, and the slope that drives the steep overlay all come from the PQS build — your [height](/Syntax/PQSMods/VertexHeightMap), [colour](/Syntax/PQSMods/VertexColorMap) and [LandControl](/Syntax/PQSMods/LandControl/LandControl) mods shape the input this shader paints.
* The fog stage (`globalDensity`, `fogColorRamp`) is only compiled in for bodies with an atmosphere; on an airless body it is removed entirely and those properties have no effect.
* Several shader inputs are driven by KSP at runtime and are not config properties: a floating-origin offset that keeps the world-space triplanar coordinates stable as the game shifts the origin around the craft, and the sun direction, camera altitude and viewer air density used by the fog.
* The surface is lit with a diffuse (Lambert) term only — there is no specular response on this shader. The PBR [MainTriplanarZoomRotation](/Syntax/Material/PQS/MainTriplanarZoomRotation) variant is the one that adds a specular term.
* `materialType = Main` is also accepted under its older alias `AtmosphericMain`, which you may see in existing configs; the two select the same shader.
