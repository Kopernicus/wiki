PQS Mods, or Procedural Quad Sphere Modifiers, are various tools beyond applying a heightmap to a planet. They can modify an object's surface as well as its color, and they are even responsible for the various anomalies on planets. They can be used to both create a planet completely from scratch like [Hodor](https://github.com/Kopernicus/KopernicusExamples/blob/master/KopernicusExamples/Creating%20New%20Bodies/ProceduralBody/Hodor.cfg) or smooth out existing heightmaps and eliminate the gridlike pattern.  They come in a wrapper node, `Mods { }`, which contains all of the PQSMod nodes and is a subnode of the `PQS { }` node. The PQS Mods are listed below.
