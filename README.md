An impartial backup of the [official wiki](https://kopernicus.tmsp.io) for the [Kopernicus plugin](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus) for Kerbal Space Program. 
The current targeted version of Kopernicus is 1.7.3-1.

# Contributing
It is preferred that all contributions be done via a text editor and a git client, as opposed to authoring the changes on GitHub.
This allows for consistent page formatting. If you wish to be able to test out changes before uploading, you must install Jekyll and its dependencies.

## Installing Jekyll
Head to [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and scroll to the bottom. 
Click the link that corresponds to your operating system and folow the directions on that page.

## Installing Git
You may use whatever Git GUI/client you wish, however they all (to my knowledge) require Git. Git 2.22.0 can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

Clone the wiki's repository to your machine. The URL is https://github.com/DeltaDizzy/Unofficial-Kop-Wiki.git
Until further notice all Jekyll work will go in the jekyll branch
