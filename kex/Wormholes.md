The `Wormhole { }` node of the Kopernicus Expansion provides the ability to transform bodies into wormholes to other bodies.

**Example**
```
Body
{
  Wormhole
  {
    partner = WormholeTarget
    influenceAltitude = 8000
    jumpMaxAltitude = 7700
    jumpMinAltitude = 10
    entryMessage = Entering the wormhole.
    exitMessage = Bye, wormhole!
    heatRate = 0.1
    entryMsgDuration = 7
    exitMsgDuration = 7
  }
}
```

|jumpMinAltitude|Double|The minimum periapsis height for jump to occur.|
|heatRate|Double|The amount of heat, in Kelvins, applied to the ship per frame while jumping.|
|entryMessage|String|The message displayed when entering the influenceAltitude.|
|exitMessage|String|The message displayed when exiting the influenceAltitude.|
